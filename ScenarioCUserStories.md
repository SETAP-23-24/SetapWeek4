# Bill Splitting App User Stories

- "I would like recurring payments to be taken automatically by the app, things like rent etc. For one-off payments I would like to be able to see evidence like a receipt and the proposed share. I would then approve the payment."

- "I would like to be able to request payments from group members. If they have missed a payment I would like an automatic notification reminding them daily of the missed payment."

- Only One main group - the people you live with.
- There can be sub groups that are for splitting the bill between some people in the group but not everyone.
